This project is a program that simulates a kingdom using a binary tree structure. Users can create a king, recruit knights, and build a hierarchy where knights are added as left or right children. The program saves the hierarchy to a file, so it can be loaded later. It includes a menu for tasks like managing the kingdom, competing in missions, and viewing the hierarchy. The design features a colorful console output and a help guide listing the team members who developed the program.
